title: About APIs and Flows
description: Introduction to the APIs and flows defined by DEPA
---

The APIs defined in this specification are both synchronous and async in nature. As a rule of thumb wherever there is a need to know the status of something in realtime, like getting status of linking or consent we use the synchronous APIs, while the rest of the specification use the asynchronous APIs.

Reference to the [OpenAPI](https://github.com/iSPIRT/DEPA/blob/main/depa_2.0.yaml) specification.
