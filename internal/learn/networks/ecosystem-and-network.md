# Ecosystem and Network

An ecosystem refers to the collection of multiple DEPA compliant networks. Within each network lies the Data Providers, Data Consumers and Consent Managers. These entities come together to enable the data exchange across multiple systems in an interoperable manner with users consent.

Ecosystem policies are applicable to all the networks within it and policies of a network are applicable to the entities joining that network.

To visualize this we can assume an ecosystem to be country wide, where ecosystem policies are governed by the laws within that country. And similarly networks can be sectoral wise where network policies are governed by the regulators of that sector within a country.
